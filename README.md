# FocusMe-for-VBA
VBA code for Outlook implementing barebones FocusMe

Go to the 'Release' folder for instructions on how to download a binary copy of this code.  There are instructions on how to "install" the binary so Outlook can use the macros.

I am always changing the code - and periodically, I will release a binary version to make it easy to incorporate the latest changes without having to remove and import specific macro files (i.e. forms, classes, modules, etc.)
