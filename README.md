# FocusMe-for-VBA
VBA code for Outlook implementing barebones FocusMe

Go to the 'Release' folder for instructions on how to download a binary copy of this code.  There are instructions on how to "install" the binary so Outlook can use the macros.

I am always changing the code - and periodically, I will release a binary version to make it easy to incorporate the latest changes without having to remove and import specific macro files (i.e. forms, classes, modules, etc.)

The VBA Version of FocusMe has these features:
- Creating projects for assignment to Tasks, Appointments, Email, Contacts, etc.
- Creating workspaces that can be used to organize projects
- Ability to track time associated with projects and workspaces (can export appointments to csv files)
- Ability to to Defer email to a task and to an appointment
- Ability to create a tracking task for an email
- Can create a 'drawer' for easy filing, and auto-filing on message reply or forward
- Can view & manage all tasks and contacts assigned to a project when using the Project Properties dialog

The .Net version of FocusMe has the VBA features and much more, learn more here:
